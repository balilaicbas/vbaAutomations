' this is specific for sellout info 
' in general this macro helps to work with a table if you need to add simple data to standardize it. In my case I need to add Year, WeekOfTheYear and NationID

Private Sub Form_Open(Cancel As Integer)
Dim Year, Week As Integer
Dim NationID As String
Dim rs As Recordset
Dim db As DAO.Database

Anno = InputBox("insert year")
Settimana = InputBox("insert week")
cdNazione = InputBox("insert nation code")

' in case you need to work on the first table you can use DoCmd.openquery, i need it because being very basic the first table is updated by copy pasting a part of an excel file that is not really cleaned
DoCmd.OpenQuery "insert query name"


Set db = CurrentDb
Set rs = db.OpenRecordset("name table you want to update with constant datas", dbOpenTable)

Do Until rs.EOF
If rs!Year = 0 Then
rs.Edit
rs![Year] = Year
rs.Update
End If
If rs!Week = 0 Then
rs.Edit
rs![Week] = Week
rs.Update
End If
If rs!NationID = "" Then
rs.Edit
rs![NationID] = NationID
rs.Update
End If
rs.MoveNext
Loop

DoCmd.Close acQuery, "name query you want to close", acSaveYes   ' in case you want to save it

End Sub
